Trying to learn scikit-learn.

Whisky clustering sounded like the perfect idea and influenced by this blog post http://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2013/12/k-means-clustering-86-single-malt-scotch-whiskies.html I thought I should try it out in scikit-learn

I found out that 6 clusters is pretty good, and that 'Caol Ila' is my next buy.
